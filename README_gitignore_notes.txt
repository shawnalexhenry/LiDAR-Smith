README: .gitignore for LiDAR/Smith

This .gitignore is tailored for the LiDAR/Smith terrain tool. It suppresses:
- Python build artifacts
- GUI temp/cache files
- Output artifacts from terrain filtering/export
- Editor folders (VSCode, PyCharm, etc.)
- Type checkers and coverage caches

It ensures clean version control, avoids UI or export noise, and aligns with Sprints 4, 6, 9, 10.

You may safely commit this .gitignore to your repo. Itâ€™s ready for GitHub or local dev use.
